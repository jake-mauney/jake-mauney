- 👋 Hi, I’m @jake-mauney
- 👀 I’m interested in maintaining a working code base for my Salesforce based projects, along with Elden Ring and Destiny 2 ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to easily package SF changes and deploy them easily, along with how to start the development of custome tools for a portfolio. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will allow me to help solve issues in an enviornment that will welcome someone still trying to learn. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
